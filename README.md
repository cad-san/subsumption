#Subsumption

##Overview
This is simple library to implements "subsumption architecture" devised by Rodney Allen Brooks.

This library doesn't implement actuators and sencers, but we provide the interfaces for sencing the environment and behavior as reactions. 

So you can make the concrete implements wheather physical robot or simulator.
